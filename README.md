ðŸŽ¯ Age Distribution Visualization of Breast Cancer Patients
This project was developed during my internship at SkillCraft Technology, focusing on data visualization within the healthcare domain. Utilizing Python's Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries, I analyzed and visualized the age distribution of breast cancer patients to uncover demographic patterns and inform healthcare strategies.


ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective
The primary goal was to:

Categorize patients into age groups (e.g., 20â€“30, 30â€“40, etc.).

Visualize the count of patients within each age group using a bar plot.

Enhance understanding of age-related trends in breast cancer incidence.
